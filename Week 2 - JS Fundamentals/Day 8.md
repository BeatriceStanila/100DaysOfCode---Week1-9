ðŸ”¸ it represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, with each object representing a part of the document, such as an element, an attribute, or a piece of text.

ðŸ”¸ allows you to manipulate the content and structure of a document, as well as to respond to events and user interactions with the document.

ðŸ”¸ it allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages that can respond to user input and change in real time.

ðŸ”¸ the HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
