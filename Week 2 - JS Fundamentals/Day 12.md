Hackathon Day!

✅ our idea was to build a Pokemon Game using the Pokemon API. There'll be two players, player1 has to choose a number between 1-20 and player2 (the computer) will get a random pokemon. The pokemon with the highest base_experience wins.

✅ fetched the data from the API using async/await

// computer: generate a random number between 1-20

// create a input
// addEventListener input
// use input to choose from pokemonList

// create a new li in the ul
// append the pokemon into the ul

//1. player: choose a pokemon number between 1-20
// fetch the selected pokemon
// select all the pokemon

//2. Computer
// select the div of computer and save into a variable
// generate a random number and save it into a variable
// use that number to match the index from pokemonList
// return the value
// push the value into the computer div

//3. Play again button
// start the game again when pressed
// while loop
