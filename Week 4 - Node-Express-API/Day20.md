✅ Morning speech from Joseph Trodden on how to overcome our inner critic

✅ Learned about middleware and installed and used the third-party middleware package MORGAN

- morgan is a Node.js and Express middleware to log HTTP requests and errors, and simplifies the process.

- in Node.js and Express, middleware is a function that has access to the request and response lifecycle methods, and the next() method to continue logic in your Express server.

✅ Served our static frond-end files using built-in middleware with our backend express rest api

✅ Separated our logic into folders - ’models’ for functions that access and modify our JSON - ‘routes’ for all our restful routers
