‚úÖ <b>How to systematically debug code?</b>

- pay attention to error messages, use console.log !!
- google things (such as error messages)
- explain your logic to another person or a duck - The rubber duck techniqueü¶Ü
- narrow down the problem and understand where the error is generated
- take a break and think about something else
- look for help
- write clean and simple code, when possible

‚úÖ <b>Introduction to Node.js</b>

- is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

- it is designed to build scalable network applications and is suitable for real-time applications that require a high amount of I/O operations.

- a <b>runtime environment</b> is a software program that runs other software programs. In the case of Node.js, it is a runtime environment for JavaScript, which means it can execute JavaScript code on a computer.

- "Cross-platform" means that the runtime environment can run on multiple platforms, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

- <b>node_modules</b> = someone else‚Äôs toolbox. We use npm install to get that person‚Äôs toolbox. NPM puts it in our node_modules folder, and then we can use our require statement to grab the tool just like we did with our core modules.

- think of queries and params as a way to pass additional info to the API that will help it determine how best to respond with what you‚Äôre asking for. It‚Äôs like air traffic control - it takes the info you‚Äôre giving it and routes you to where you need to go in the code to get to the correct quote that handles the response.

‚úÖ What is a Module?

- a module in JS is just a file containing related code

- node.js supports CommonJS module format by default

  - loads using require()
  - variables and functions export from a CommonJS module with module.exports

‚úÖ What is Middleware?

- code that runs (on the server) between getting a request and sending a response
