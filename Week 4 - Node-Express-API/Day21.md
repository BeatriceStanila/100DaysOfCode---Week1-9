âœ… Hackathon - Build a Backend Recipe Server

- need to write some code to get this application running. Your server will function as an API like we've been building and also serve an HTML page.

- should see a website at http://localhost:3000 when the server is running. A very basic front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) is currently served. Don't change the front end yet. You'll start by building a back end that fits its needs.

- first, using the table below as a guide, get your CRUD routes up and running in your router so that your server listens for requests and serves test/example responses for now. Remember that you can test your routes with Postman to ensure they're working.

- a great way to organize your server's code and modularize for separating concerns is to put the logic that interacts with the data into models and then export and import them where needed - this way, the router only handles the routing.
