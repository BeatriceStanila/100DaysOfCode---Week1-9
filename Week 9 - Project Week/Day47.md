New Team: Tariq, Jason and Damian

## Team HakunaMatata - Flash it!

--- Our goal is to create a question/answer app that bootcampers can use to prepare for future interviews ---

✅ using what we've learned on the course so far to try and improve the lives of our users (bootcampers)

- What do they need?
- What problem might they have that your application could solve for them?
- How can you get into the mindset of your user and keep them at the centre of your problem-solving?

✅ first we created our manifesto board

✅ spent some time thinking about problems and how to solve them by moving each idea through the dreamer, realist and critic Disney ideation rooms
