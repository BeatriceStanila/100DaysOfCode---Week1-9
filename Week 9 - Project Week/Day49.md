✅ linked backend with frontend using axios instead of fetch

- axios is a JavaScript library that allows you to make HTTP requests to a server

- it can be used in both the browser and in Node.js

- is promise-based and makes it easy to handle HTTP responses and errors

- the data in fetch() is transformed to a string using the JSON.stringify method

- axios automatically transforms the data returned from the server, but with fetch() you have to call the response.json method to parse the data to a JavaScript object

✅ fetched the data from database with useEffect hook

✅ installed google chrome cors extension (next time will install the package)

✅ created the functionality for each button of the app

✅ MVP completed
