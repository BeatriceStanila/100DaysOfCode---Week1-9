âœ… Reac-athon !!!

- we created a Google-ish Translator using an external data from a free API source

- we started with Figma where we created our wireframe and the component tree

- initialized a new react app and created our components

- really understand how to use the useState Hook

- learned how to fetch data from the API using the useEffect Hook

- we manage to change what word to be translated dynamically
