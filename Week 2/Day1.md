ðŸ”¸DOM

- the Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

- it represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, with each object representing a part of the document, such as an element, an attribute, or a piece of text.

- allows you to manipulate the content and structure of a document, as well as to respond to events and user interactions with the document.

- it allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages that can respond to user input and change in real time.

- the HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

ðŸ”¸addEventListener

- is a method that is used to attach an event handler to an element in a document. It is commonly used in combination with JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages.

- the event handler function is a function that will be called when the event occurs. It can be used to perform any actions that you want to happen in response to the event
