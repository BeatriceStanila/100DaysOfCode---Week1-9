âœ… Computational thinking - involves a number of key skills and concepts:

    ðŸ”¸DECOMPOSITION: breaking a complex problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be solved independently

    ðŸ”¸PATTERNS: recognizing patterns and regularities in data, and using them to make predictions and solve problems.

    ðŸ”¸ABSTRACTION: identifying the key features of a problem and ignoring the details that are not relevant to solving it.

    ðŸ”¸ALGORITHMIC THINKING: designing a step-by-step process to solve a problem, or to accomplish a task.

    ðŸ”¸GENERALIZATION: recognizing when different problems have a common solution, and using that solution to solve all of them.

âœ… Git Rhythm

    ðŸ”¸Git Rhythm is based on the "git flow" workflow, which is a popular Git workflow model that helps developers manage their Git repositories in a consistent and organized way.

    ðŸ”¸The git flow workflow is based on the idea of having two main branches in a Git repository: the "master" branch, which represents the production-ready code, and the "develop" branch, which is used for ongoing development work.
