✅ Learned about testing pyramid

- test automation pyramid functions at three levels

  - UNIT TESTING, also known as component testing, is a level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested - the purpose is to validate that each unit of software performs as designed

  - INTEGRATION TESTING is the second step of the software testing pyramid to verify the interaction of this code with other codes in the application, which generally comprise the overall software.

        - These tests check how a code interacts with external components.
        - are generally slower than unit tests due to the necessity of interaction with external sources. They also require a pre-production environment to run.

  - End-to-end Testing - checks the enormous bulk of code (the entire application) - it uses a test environment and data to simulate real-world functionality. - it is the most expensive to maintain and has the slowest operating p

✅ Learned how to use Jest to do basic unit testing in node using Jest
