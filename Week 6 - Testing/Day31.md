✅ Practiced how to install and use Cypress for E2E tests

✅ Learned how to run integration tests using Supertest and Jest

- Supertest is a Node. js library that allows developers and testers to test the APIs.

- It enables developers and testers to write automated tests for routes and endpoints.

- Supertest can be used as a standalone library or with testing frameworks like Mocha and Jest.

- Jest is a javascript test runner for running automated tests, and supertest provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP. The app that we will be testing will will contain a single endpoint to POST a new user given a username and password.
