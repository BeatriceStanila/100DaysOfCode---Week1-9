âœ… What is design thinking?

ðŸ”¸is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.

âœ… The five phases of design thinking:

ðŸ”¸ EMPATHIZE - research your user's needs

ðŸ”¸ DEFINE - state your user's needs and problems

ðŸ”¸ IDEATE - challenge assumptions and create ideas

ðŸ”¸ PROTOTYPE - start to create solutions

ðŸ”¸ TEST - try your solutions out

ðŸ”¸ CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope, change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries.

The syntax of the var() function is as follows:
var( --name, value)
