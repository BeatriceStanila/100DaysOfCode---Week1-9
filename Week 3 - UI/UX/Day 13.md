âœ… New team: Peter M. and Marcel M.

âœ… AGILE

ğŸ”¸ is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.

ğŸ”¸ an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments.

ğŸ”¸ requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

âœ… AGILE: the 4 core values

ğŸ”¸ Individuals and interactions over precesses and tools
ğŸ”¸ Working software over comprehensive documentation
ğŸ”¸ Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
ğŸ”¸ Responding to change over following a plan

âœ… AGILE: the goal

ğŸ”¸develop iteratively: a way of breaking down the software development of a large application into smaller chunks

ğŸ”¸adaptive planning to reduce risks

ğŸ”¸easy tracking and delivery management

ğŸ”¸better product quality

âœ… UI/UX interactions

ğŸ”¸ UI design is all about how the product's interfaces look and function
ğŸ”¸ much of their work focuses on finding out what kinds of problems and pain-points users come up against, and how a certain product might solve them.

âœ… Integrating UX and AGILE

ğŸ”¸ technically feasible: they can be developed into functional products or processes

ğŸ”¸ economically viable: the business can afford to implement them

ğŸ”¸ desirable for the user: they meet a real human need

ğŸ”¸ with agile: - client tells UX what they vision - UX cycles through User-Centered-Design tasks UX iterates - UX tests it to ensure it's a great solution - client and users like it - UX delivers it to developer. Ready to build once
