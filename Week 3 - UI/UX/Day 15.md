âœ… CSS specificity

ðŸ”¸ if there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.

ðŸ”¸ ID value = 100

ðŸ”¸ CLASS value = 10

ðŸ”¸ ELEMENT selector or pseudo-element = 1

ðŸ”¸ Inline style gets a specificity value of 1000, and is always given the highest priority!

ðŸ”¸ There is one exception to this rule: if you use the !important rule, it will even override inline styles!
