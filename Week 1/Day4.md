✅ objects

- are key/value stores of information.

- can get the value out by knowing what key it is stored under, using the dot notation or []

- the values can be of any data type, including arrays and other objects.

✅ arrays

- a collection of values that are stored in a contiguous block of memory.

- use arrays to store a collection of data such as a list of numbers, names, or any other type of data.

- can access the elements of an array using square brackets and an index, which is the position of the element in the array.

- the first element in an array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.
