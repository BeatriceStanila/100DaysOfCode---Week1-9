Hackathon Friday - Build a todo app

TODO app

- installed react app
- structured our components
- imported/exported components using the JS6 method
- created our app structure using the component tree model
- used the useState hook to create functionality (save the inputsâ€™ value, display it in the list, delete a row)
- used the spread operator to create a copy of the initial array
