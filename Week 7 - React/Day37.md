✅ smart and dumb components

- Dumb components are also called ‘presentational’ components because their only responsibility is to present something to the DOM. Once that is done, the component is done with it. No keeping tabs on it, no checking in once in a while to see how things are going.

- Smart components (or container components) on the other hand have a different responsibility. Because they have the burden of being smart, they are the ones that keep track of state and care about how the app works.

✅ useState () Hook

- a Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features

- useState is a hook in React that adds state to functional components. It takes a single argument, which is the initial state, and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function that can be used to update the state

- when we are using a use state hook we are going to get back to values:

a. the first thing is the actual variable with the value inside of it that we actually want to use

b. the second thing is a function that when called will set the variable to whatever we call it to

✅ made our plan using the component tree structure

- the Component Tree represents a library of defined components which can then be added to Component Sets or Flows that specify a test instance.
